# Embedded-System



Created a self automated matching game with C programming using Quartus II (develop the virtual circuit) and Nios II(development software) This program was designed to run on DE10 Lite which is a FPGA board. 

The game board is initialize with array of 24 by 16. The number is random generated by a "seed" (the seed determines what the game board will be). The program will detect vertically, horizontally, and diagonally for three of the same letters or numbers. If there are matches found, it will highlight the matches, tally up the score, and generate a new game board of numbers. The game ends when there are no more matching numbers generated.
